# Picklevision
The repository for the Picklevision texture pack made for Minecraft.

Hope you all enjoy this stupid texture pack I made, it means a lot to me.

To download the stable build, use the links below:

### Some things to note before using this:

- This pack is only for Java. Bedrock is a spaghetti mess that I can't seem to be able to figure out yet.
- Make sure you use the latest version to get new features / fix bugs.
