It's built from the ground up by KolaKattz.

Hope you all enjoy this stupid texture pack I made, it means a lot to me.

To use it, just put the zip file in resourcepacks in .minecraft.

### Some things to note before using this:

- This pack is only for Java. Bedrock is a spaghetti mess.
- Make sure you use the latest version to get new features / fix bugs.
